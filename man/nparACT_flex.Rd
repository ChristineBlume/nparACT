\title{Computes the classic non-parametric actigraphy measures
interdaily stability (IS), intradaily variability (IV),
and relative amplitude (RA), as well as the L5 and M10 values
and their respective start times. In addition, the function
computes a flexible low-activity period (Lflex) of user-defined
duration and its start time for a single actigraphy file.}
\usage{
nparACT_flex(name, SR, cutoff = 1, minutes, plot = T, fulldays = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Character string giving the name of the object in the
workspace that contains the actigraphy data.}

\item{SR}{Numeric. Sampling rate in Hertz (samples per second).}

\item{cutoff}{Numeric. Activity threshold used to classify movement.
Defaults to 1.}

\item{minutes}{Numeric. Length of the flexible low-activity window
(Lflex) in minutes.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, diagnostic plots of the hourly
and minute-wise activity profiles are generated. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{fulldays}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, data are truncated to include
only complete 24-hour periods. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row and the following columns:
\describe{
\item{IS}{Interdaily stability}
\item{IV}{Intradaily variability}
\item{RA}{Relative amplitude}
\item{L5}{Mean activity during the least active 5-hour period}
\item{L5_starttime}{Start time of the L5 period}
\item{M10}{Mean activity during the most active 10-hour period}
\item{M10_starttime}{Start time of the M10 period}
\item{Lflex}{Mean activity during the least active flexible period}
\item{Lflex_starttime}{Start time of the Lflex period}
}
}
\description{
The function expects the actigraphy data to be available in the
workspace under the name provided via \code{name}. Data are internally
pre-processed, optionally restricted to complete 24-hour periods,
and analysed using standard non-parametric actigraphy algorithms.
}
\details{
The input data may contain either two columns (time, activity) or
three columns (date, time, activity). Time variables are internally
converted to \code{POSIXct}. Missing values in the activity signal
are not permitted.

Interdaily stability (IS) and intradaily variability (IV) are computed
from hourly averaged activity data. Relative amplitude (RA) is derived
from the difference between the most active 10-hour period (M10) and
the least active 5-hour period (L5). The flexible low-activity measure
(Lflex) represents the least active contiguous period of the duration
specified by \code{minutes}.
